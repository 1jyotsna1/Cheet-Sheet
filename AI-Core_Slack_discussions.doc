This was shared by my company Director(Machine Learning), thought of sharing this with everyone since we all are starting our journey with Python.
It’s called “The Zen of Python”, written by Tim Peters(major contributor to python).
These are the basic guiding principles for writing good programs in python. Do give it a read

Explanation for all the above principles in the below article:

If someone is eager for more assignments in Python you can do some on your own. Hackerrank: https://www.hackerrank.com/ is a good place to be and start practicing on interesting problems, https://leetcode.com/ for the ones feeling more advanced.


For anyone who's curious about multiple inheritance https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277367/how-does-pythons-super-work-with-multiple-inheritance/3277407#3277407 provides more details
